# hello-world
nothing to see here
This is my first time using Github and "making " a repository.  I don't even know the lingo yet! I'm taking a Data Science class and we are using RStudio, which is another mystery to me thus far. But bfore I give up al hope I shall aask my dog, Toby, to give his opinion.  Lesson #1: the dog is always right.  Down the rabbit hole we go!
